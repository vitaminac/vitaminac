Hi everyone 👋!

I’m currently working as a software engineer 👨‍💻 at Amazon. I'm actively developing my skills to become an even better programmer 💪. Over the past few years, I’ve earned [several certifications](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shuxig/details/certifications/), and I'm continuously expanding my knowledge in the field. I am now studying deep learning and diving into some [recommended resources](ai.md) to explore its potential to transform industries.

Beyond programming, I’m passionate about reading 📖, particularly in the areas of philosophy, physics, history and economics. Exploring books in these fields brings fresh insights that inspire my personal and professional growth.

Feel free to connect and share book recommendations, AI resources, or other insights. I'm always open to learning and collaborating with fellow developers! 🚀
